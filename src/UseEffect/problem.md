- Fetching Data: Create a component that fetches data from an API when it mounts using useEffect. - `Done`

- Subscribing to Events: Implement a component that subscribes to a global event when it mounts and unsubscribes when it unmounts using useEffect.

- Updating Document Title: Create a component that updates the document title based on a state variable using useEffect. - `Done`

- Timer or Interval: Implement a countdown timer or interval that starts when the component mounts and stops when it unmounts using useEffect.

- Conditional Effects: Write a component where the effect runs conditionally based on some state variable or prop change using useEffect.-

Basic Data Fetching:

Create a component that fetches data from an API (e.g., https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) and displays the results in a list.

Use useEffect to perform the data fetching when the component mounts.

Interval Timer:

Create a component that displays a counter and updates it every second using setInterval.

Use useEffect to set up and clean up the interval timer.

Conditional Effect:

Create a component that fetches data from an API when a button is clicked.

Use useEffect to fetch data only when the button is clicked and a state variable is set.

Clean-up Effect:

Create a component that sets up an event listener (e.g., window resize event) and cleans it up when the component unmounts.

Use useEffect to manage the event listener.

Data Fetch with Dependency:

Create a component that fetches data from an API based on a search input.

Use useEffect to fetch data whenever the search input changes, using the search input as a dependency.
